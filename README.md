## Hi there!! ðŸ‘‹

**Paul here.**  I'm currently a _Cloud Platform Team Lead_ for [National Information Solutions Cooperative (NISC)](https://www.nisc.coop/) in [Lake St. Louis, Missouri](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lake+St+Louis,+MO/@38.7734922,-95.2744848,6z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x87ded06657c1d3bb:0xdb8a4e9fb3096f21!8m2!3d38.7809384!4d-90.7883604).

I've been developing software professionally since around 1997 after a major career change from accountancy.  Creating automated sales and profitability analyses using _VisualBasic for Applications_ within _Microsoft Excel_ piqued my interest, so I decided to take a class in _C++_ (you can overload operators?!)...I was hooked!  Now I knew my true passion for designing and implementing software solutions.

I started my professional software career writing in _Visual FoxPro_ and _VisualBasic_.  I then moved on to _Java_ shortly after Y2K and continued with that for many, many years.  I've also done some _C#_, _Python_, and even a little _Perl_. 

Cloud technologies are my bag these days; [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Linkerd](https://linkerd.io/), [Helm](https://helm.sh/), and [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/).  My latest obsession is the [Go](https://golang.org/) programming language; mostly because it's different and fun for me.  I'm even the organizer for the [St. Louis Go Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/StL-Go/) group.
