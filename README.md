## Hi there!! ðŸ‘‹

**Paul here.**  I'm currently a _Cloud Platform Team Lead_ for [National Information Solutions Cooperative (NISC)](https://www.nisc.coop/) in [Lake St. Louis, Missouri](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lake+St+Louis+Township,+MO/@38.7795132,-90.8021833,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x87decfcc7aa7233f:0xac516ecc09368107!8m2!3d38.7866812!4d-90.762788).

I've been developing software professionally since around 1997 after a major career change from accountancy.  Creating automated sales and profitability analyses using VisualBasic for Applications within Microsoft Excel piqued my interest, so I decided to take a class in C++...I was hooked!  Now I knew my true passion for designing and implementing software solutions.

I started my professional software career writing in Visual FoxPro and VisualBasic.  I then moved on to Java shortly after Y2K and continued with that for many, many years.  I've also done some C#, Python, and even a little Perl. 

Cloud technologies are my bag these days; [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Linkerd](https://linkerd.io/), [Helm](https://helm.sh/), and [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/).  My latest obsession is the [Go](https://golang.org/) programming language; mostly because it's different and fun for me.  I'm even the organizer for the [St. Louis Go Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/StL-Go/) group.
