## Hi there!! ðŸ‘‹

**Paul here.**  I'm currently a CNCF Ambassador, a friend of GoBridge, software architect, developer advocate. You may have seen me online or speaking during my experience as a Developer Advocate at [k6](https://k6.io/) and [Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com/). With any of these roles, I'm hoping to ease the pains of Developers, Site Reliability Engineers, and Testers all while creating some fun learning. 

I've been developing software professionally since around 1997 after a major career change from accountancy. Creating automated sales and profitability analyses using _VisualBasic for Applications_ within _Microsoft Excel_ piqued my interest, so I decided to take a class in _C++_ (you can overload operators?!)...I was hooked! Now I knew my true passion was for designing and implementing software solutions.

I started my professional software career writing in _Visual FoxPro_ and _VisualBasic_.  I then moved on to _Java_ shortly after Y2K, continuing with that for many, many years.  I've also done some _C#_, _Python_, and even a little _Perl_. The _Go_ programming language is now my favorite jam!

As a _CNCF Ambassador_, cloud native technologies are my bag these days; [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Linkerd](https://linkerd.io/), [Helm](https://helm.sh/), [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/), etc.  My latest obsession is the [Go](https://golang.org/) programming language; mostly because it's different and fun for me.  With this, I help out the community as a _GoBridge Ambassador_ and I'm even the organizer for the [St. Louis Go Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/StL-Go/), [St. Louis chapter of Cloud Native Community Groups](https://community.cncf.io/saint-louis/), [Grafana & Friends - St. Louis](https://www.meetup.com/grafana-friends-st-louis-meetup-group/), and [MO Reliability](https://www.meetup.com/mo-reliability/) groups.
